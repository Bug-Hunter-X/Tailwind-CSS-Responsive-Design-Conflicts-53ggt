# Tailwind CSS Responsive Design Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Tailwind CSS related to unexpected behavior when using multiple responsive directives (`md:`, `lg:`, etc.) in conjunction with other utility classes.  The problem often results in inconsistent styling across different screen sizes.

## Bug Description

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Resize your browser window to observe the inconsistent styling across different screen sizes.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates a possible solution, emphasizing careful ordering of classes and potentially using more specific or parent selectors to resolve the conflict.
