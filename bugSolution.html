The solution typically involves careful consideration of the order of your Tailwind classes and ensuring specificity.  Sometimes adding more specific selectors or restructuring your HTML can help isolate and resolve conflicts. 

For example, instead of relying solely on overlapping responsive modifiers, consider using more specific selectors or separating styles into different classes:
```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <div class="md:bg-gray-200 lg:bg-gray-300">
    <p>This is some text.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
Alternatively, you can use the `@apply` directive to apply a pre-defined set of styles with a specific order:
```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 @apply md:bg-gray-200 lg:bg-gray-300"></div>
```
This gives you explicit control over the order of styles, helping to prevent unintended overrides.  Using the Tailwind CSS DevTools can help with debugging by letting you see the computed styles applied to each element.
